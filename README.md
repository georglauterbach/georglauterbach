## Who I Am

I am a computer scientist with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) from Technische UniversitÃ¤t (TU) Dresden in Germany who has specialized in systems programming, memory safety, operating system kernels, containers, and the Rust programming language.

If you'd like to get the basic set of tooling that I use on a daily basis, head over to [`georglauterbach/hermes`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/hermes).

## What I Do on GitHub

I write a lot of Bash for [`docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver) - one of GitHub's largest containerized mail server projects. DMS provides everyone with the ability to host their mail server in a containerized environment, like Docker Compose, Podman or Kubernetes. Beyond DMS, I have a library for useful Bash functions that anyone can use freely called [`georglauterbach/libbash`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/libbash).

Tooling for proper software development is a key interest of mine. Hence, I am curating [Development Container](https://containers.dev/) features in [`georglauterbach/dev-container-features`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/dev-container-features).

You can also find a "Getting Started" project for a kernel in Rust targeting the RISC-V platform in my repository called [`georglauterbach/uncore`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/uncore).
