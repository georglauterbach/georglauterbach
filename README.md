## What I Do on GitHub

I am well-versed in Bash and write a lot for [`docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver` (DMS)](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver) - GitHub's largest containerized mail server project. DMS provides everyone with the ability to host their mail server in a containerized environment, like Docker Compose, Podman or Kubernetes. Beyond DMS, I have a library for useful Bash functions that anyone can use freely called [`georglauterbach/libbash`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/libbash).

Tooling for proper software development is a key interest of mine. I am curating a [Development Container](https://containers.dev/) features in [`georglauterbach/dev-container-features`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/dev-container-features). If you'd like to get the basic set of tooling that I use on a daily basis, head over to [`georglauterbach/hermes`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/hermes).

I have specialized in operating system kernels, memory safety, and the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I am trying to continue to work on these topics. You can find a "Getting Started" project for a kernel in Rust targeting the RISC-V platform in my repository called [`georglauterbach/uncore`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/uncore).
