## Who I Am

I am a computer scientist with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Science from Technische UniversitÃ¤t (TU) Dresden in Germany. I have specialized in operating system kernels and memory safety. At university, I learned two important facts:

1. Abstraction is not about vagueness, it is about being precise on a new semantic level.
2. Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.

Both of these sentences are from [_Edsger Wybe Dijkstra_](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/dijkstra_1053701.cfm).

## What I Do

I write a lot of Bash, mostly for [`docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver` (DMS)](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver) - GitHub's largest containerized mail server project. DMS provides everyone with the ability to host their mail server in a containerized environment, like Docker Compose, Podman or Kubernetes.

Tooling for proper software development is a key interest of mine. Therefore, I am also curating a [Development Container](https://containers.dev/) base image called [`georglauterbach/dev-container-base`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/dev-container-base) and additional features in [`georglauterbach/dev-container-features`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/dev-container-features). If you'd like to get my basic set of tooling I use on a day-to-day basis on my Ubuntu Linux machine, head over to [`georglauterbach/hermes`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/hermes).

I have specialized in operating system kernels and the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) at university, and I am trying to continue to work on these topics. You can find a "Getting Started" project for a kernel in Rust targeting the RISC-V platform in my repository called [`georglauterbach/uncore`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/uncore).
