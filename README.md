## Who I Am

I am a computer scientist with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) from Technische UniversitÃ¤t (TU) Dresden in Germany who has specialized in operating system kernels and memory safety.

## What I Do on GitHub

I write a lot of Bash, mostly for [`docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver` (DMS)](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver) - GitHub's largest containerized mail server project. DMS provides everyone with the ability to host their mail server in a containerized environment, like Docker Compose, Podman or Kubernetes. Beyond DMS, I have a library for useful Bash functions that anyone can use freely called [`georglauterbach/libbash`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/libbash).

Tooling for proper software development is a key interest of mine. Therefore, I am curating a [Development Container](https://containers.dev/) base image called [`georglauterbach/dev-container-base`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/dev-container-base) and additional features in [`georglauterbach/dev-container-features`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/dev-container-features). If you'd like to get the basic set of tooling that I use on a daily basis, head over to [`georglauterbach/hermes`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/hermes).

I have specialized in operating system kernels and the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and I am trying to continue to work on these topics. You can find a "Getting Started" project for a kernel in Rust targeting the RISC-V platform in my repository called [`georglauterbach/uncore`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/uncore). I have also started work on a new supervisor system called _COMPUTER_ that is written in Rust too. As you can see, I love Rust and I am openly advocation for its usage.

## About Computer Science

At university, I learned two important facts: Abstraction is not about vagueness, it is about being precise on a new semantic level; and computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. Both of these sentences are from [_Edsger Wybe Dijkstra_](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/dijkstra_1053701.cfm).
