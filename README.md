I am a computer scientist with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) from Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden (Germany) who focuses on systems programming, memory safety, operating system kernels, containers, and the Rust programming language.

If you'd like to get the basic set of tools that I use on a daily basis, head over to [`georglauterbach/hermes`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/hermes). You can find [my VS Code configuration](https://github.com/georglauterbach/hermes/blob/main/data/examples/vs_code/settings.jsonc) there as well.

I maintain [`docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver) (DMS) - one of GitHub's largest containerized mail server projects - together with a few awesome other developers. DMS provides everyone with the ability to host their mail server in a containerized environment, like Docker Compose, Podman or Kubernetes. Beyond DMS, I have a library for useful Bash functions that anyone can use freely called [`georglauterbach/libbash`](https://github.com/georglauterbach/libbash).
